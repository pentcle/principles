                <h2>You can’t build trustless systems without trust</h2>
                <p>Yearn runs on trust. It fosters strong connections and makes things run smoothly, allowing Yearn to
                    circumvent the burdens of traditional corporate middle management. We move at the speed of trust
                    because we believe it’s the most efficient way to get things done – all our other principles are
                    possible because we choose to trust each other. </p>

                <h2>Do’ers, do.</h2>
                <p>Belief is great, but building is better. As a contributor, you are the person who knows best what to
                    do for Yearn. We don’t wait for approvals or authorization, permission is self granted, and action
                    is revered. At Yearn self starters have nothing between them and the glorious horizon. The future
                    belongs to those who do.</p>

                <h2>Revere one another.</h2>
                <p>Friction is inevitable, but conflict doesn’t have to be. We operate under the assumption that our
                    fellow contributors are fundamentally good, reasonable, and trustworthy. Stir some hard work, talent
                    and capability into the mix and it’s easy to see why even when things go wrong, we always take the
                    Most Respectful Interpretation of each others actions.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Boxes are for squares.</h2>
                <p>Creativity is our competitive edge. When boldness is met with trust and empathy, magic occurs. We
                    understand that the craziest ideas can spawn entirely new industries – Yearn is living proof of it.
                    No thought is too crazy, no plan too weird, no ambition too out there. Yearn exists in a realm
                    beyond nation state borders, but we’re proud to let our freak flag fly.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>You are what you do.</h2>
                <p>Yearn is a place that values ideas over identity. Whether you’re a defi og or a noob on the Discord,
                    the best contributions will always be respected. We’re all for personality, but never cult of
                    personality. Here, work always trumps credentials – we don’t care who you are, only what you do.</p>

                <h2><3 Chaos.</h2>
                <p>Decentralization isn’t just best for the protocol, it’s also best for the people building it. The
                    future doesn’t look like a corporate strategy deck or some complex org chart. It looks like nature –
                    messy, chaotic and full of surprises. Yearn find order from chaos, scaling in harmony with radical
                    change.</p>

        <article class="bg-07" id="community">
            <div>
                <h2>Humans and code.</h2>
                <p>The protocol isn’t our only product. Yearn is a generative community of independent builders who are
                    free to sprout new organizations and grow the network organically. Each day Yearn supports the
                    flourishing Defi ecosystem by uniting exceptional people around radical projects that make finance
                    more flexible and accessible. This synergistic relationship guides Yearn to build its code and
                    community with integrity.</p>
