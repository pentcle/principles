                <h2>You can’t build trustless systems without trust.</h2>
                <p>Yearn runs on trust. Trust fosters strong connections and helps things run smoothly, allowing Yearn
                    to circumvent the burdens of traditional corporate middle management. We move at the speed of trust
                    because we believe it’s the most efficient way to get things done – all our other principles are
                    possible because we choose to trust each other. </p>

            <div>
                <h2>Do’ers, do.</h2>
                <p>Belief is great, but building is better. As a contributor, you are the person who knows what’s best
                    to do for Yearn. We don’t wait for approvals or authorization, permission is self granted, and
                    action is revered. At Yearn self starters have nothing between them and the glorious horizon. The
                    future belongs to those who do.</p>

        <article class="green" id="respect">
            <div>
                <h2>Revere one another.</h2>
                <p>Friction is inevitable, but conflict doesn’t have to be. We operate under the assumption that our
                    fellow contributors are fundamentally good, reasonable, and trustworthy. Stir some hard work, talent
                    and capability into the mix and it’s easy to see why even when things go wrong, we always take the
                    Most Respectful Interpretation of each others actions.</p>

        <article class="blue" id="creativity">
            <div>
                <h2>Boxes are for squares.</h2>
                <p>Creativity is our competitive edge. When boldness is met with trust and empathy, magic occurs. We
                    understand that the craziest ideas can spawn entirely new industries – Yearn is living proof of it.
                    No thought is too crazy, no plan too weird, no ambition too out there. Yearn exists in a realm
                    beyond nation state borders, but we’re proud to let our freak flag fly.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>You are what you do.</h2>
                <p>Yearn is a place that values ideas over identity. Whether you’re a defi og or a newb on the Discord,
                    the best contributions will always be respected. We’re all for personality, but never cult of
                    personality. Here, work always trumps credentials – we don’t care who you are, only what you do.</p>

            <div>
                <h2><3 Chaos.</h2>
                <p>Decentralization isn’t just best for the protocol, it’s also best for the people building it. The
                    future doesn’t look like a corporate strategy deck or some complex org chart. It looks like nature –
                    messy, chaotic and full of surprises. Yearn find order from chaos, scaling in harmony with other
                    orgs and the wider space. </p>

        <article class="purple" id="community">
            <div>
                <h2>Humans and code.</h2>
                <p>The protocol isn’t our only product. Yearn is a community of independent builders who are free to
                    sprout new organizations and grow the network organically. Each day Yearn supports the flourishing
                    Defi ecosystem by uniting exceptional people around radical projects that make finance more flexible
                    and accessible. This synergistic relationship guides Yearn to build its code and community with
                    integrity.</p>
